# Probability Fundamentals 
Basic probability, probability models, and introduction to discrete and continuous random variables.

# What is Probability?
- Probability, denoted as *P(A)* are maps that assign numbers to subsets within a defined sample space. Probability has to be within 0 - 1

- Objectivits: Relate probability to the relative frequency of outcomes
- Subjectivits: View it as a degree of belief called **Bayesian probability**

 A probability measure, denoted as P, must satisfy two key properties: the probability of the whole space is 1, and the probability of the empty event is 0.

**The Classical Interpretation of Probability**: Assumes that all outcomes are equally likely to happen. An example of this would be a coin toss. Two equally likely results. The **formula of calculating probability** is:

The number of ways an event (A) can occur is effectively a sample size. The classical approach faces issues when the data doesn't have an equal chance of occurring. In which you would use another method such as the empirical or subjective approach.
