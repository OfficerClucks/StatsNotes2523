# Probability Fundamentals 
Basic probability, probability models, an introduction to discrete and continuous random variables.

# What is Probability?
- Probability, denoted as *P(A)* are maps that assign numbers to subsets within a
defined sample space
- Ω a sample space often represented as a rectangle or square
- Objectivits: Relate probability to the relative frequency of outcomes
- Subjectivits: View it as a degree of belief called **Bayesian probability**

  A probability measure, denoted as P, must satisfy two key
properties: the probability of the whole space is 1, and the probability of the empty event is 0.
