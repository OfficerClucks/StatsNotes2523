# Chapter 2 What is counting?

**Counting Objects**: Determining the number of ways objects and be arranged or combined.

**Combinations and Arrangements**: arranging or selecting objects such as choosing outfits or forming teams for a sport

**Probability and Chance**: Counting theory is closely related to probability theory which is predicting the likelyhood of events.

**Permutations in Everyday Language**: Arrangements in a particular order.

**Combinations in Decision-Making**: In decision-making processes, people often need to select a subset of items from a larger set without regard to the order.

## Three Fundamental Concepts

- Product Rule :  : The product rule addresses scenarios where a **sequence** of
tasks or choices is performed **independently**, with each task having multiple possible outcomes. 

It states that if there are n1 ways to perform the first task, n2 ways
to perform the second task, and so on until the kth task with nk
ways, then the total number of outcomes is the product of the
number of ways for each task.

The product rule can be expressed mathematically as:

𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑠 = 𝐧𝟏 × 𝐧𝟐 × ⋯ × 𝐧𝐤







- Sum rule: The sum rule serves as a companion to the product rule,
stepping in when there exist multiple mutually exclusive ways to
accomplish a task

- Bijections: Bijections, also known as one-to-one correspondences, are fundamental concepts in mathematics that provide a powerful tool for establishing relationships between sets we'll delve into the foundational concepts of counting methods
